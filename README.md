# Determine kth largest

The code implements an algorithm to find kth largest value given a group of N numbers. Since the algorithm sorts
numbers in descending order using bubblesort, it is not the most optimal algorithm. 

To run the program, you need to have Python installed (preferably 3.11.1 or higher). You can use an IDE to run the program or type py kthLargest.py in command prompt. It's recommended to use an IDE like VScode to get proper measurement of execution time of algorithm.
